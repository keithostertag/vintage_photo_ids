Early (novice) demo page for random selection of images and Responsive Design

A fun little blast-from-the-past demo for randomly selecting an image
and using Responsive Design to alter the size of the image depending
on device. When accessed from a phone the image size and background
color will also be changed depending on orientation.

There is no text on this page- the user merely clicks/taps on the current image and the next random image displays.

This page was my first page written after beginning study, kept here mainly for historical reasons.

This page uses plain vanilla javascript.

This page can be accessed online at: card16.com/3
